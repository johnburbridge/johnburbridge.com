where I fiddle with stuff
-------------------------

If you're reading this readme, you're likely lost. No, seriously. The source 
code contained here is used to build [my personal website](http://www.johnburbridge.com), 
which serves absolutely no purpose at all, other than providing me with a sandbox to try
out new tools / technology before applying them in the real world. In other words, it's
a glorified scratch-pad is really what I'm saying.

At the current moment I'm interested in software that begins with the letter G,
such as:

* [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) 
* [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)
* [Grails](http://www.grails.org)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Gerrit](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)

I also happen to have [a continuous integration site running Jenkins](http://build.johnburbridge.net:8081/jenkins/) 
which polls github every 5 minutes for updates, builds, runs unit tests, code coverage, integration tests and submits the 
freshly minted snapshot artifacts to [an Artifactory repository](http://repo.johnburbridge.net:8081/artifactory).

Oh, okay - technically Jenkins, Artifactory, CodeNarc, Cargo, and Sonar don't begin with the letter G but 
it sure sounded like a pretty arbitrary way of picking tools. I blame Google. They must have something to
do with this.

At any rate, if you have any comments about any of the source code hosted here, please feel free to drop
me a line.

Happy development, 
JB
