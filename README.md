where I fiddle with stuff
-------------------------

If you're reading this readme, you're likely lost. No, seriously. The source 
code contained here is used to build [my personal website](http://www.johnburbridge.com), 
which serves absolutely no purpose at all than for me to try out new technology. 

At the current moment I'm interested in software that begins with the letter G,
such as:

* [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) 
* [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)
* [Grails](http://www.grails.org)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Gerrit](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)

I also happen to have [a continuous integration site running Jenkins](http://build.johnburbridge.net:8081/jenkins/) 
which polls github every 5 minutes for updates, builds, runs unit tests, code coverage, integration tests and submits the 
freshly minted snapshot artifacts to [an Artifactory repository](http://repo.johnburbridge.net:8081/artifactory).

But that's it! Aside from Jenkins, Artifactory, CodeNarc, Cargo, and Sonar every other major framework or tool I 
use on my personal website begins with the letter G. 

If you have any comments about any of the source code hosted here, please feel free to drop me a line.

Cheers,  
JB
