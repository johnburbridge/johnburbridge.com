where I fiddle with stuff
-------------------------

If you're reading this readme, you're likely lost. No, seriously. The source 
code contained here is used to build my personal website, which serves absolutely
no purpose at all than for me to exercise and experiment with new technology. 

At the current moment I'm interested in technology that begins with the letter G,
such as:

* gradle
* groovy
* grails
* git
* gerrit

The code that is listed here is continuously built using Jenkins and the binaries
are served through an Artifactory repository.

That said, if you have any comments about any of the source code hosted here, please
feel free to drop me a line.

Cheers,
JB
